            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The Rebels are very ≈øtrong, having great bodies abroad, making ≈øeueral inroades up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Prote≈øtants quarters; yet not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ≈øo often, as formerly, by rea≈øon of the gallant motion, and happy ≈øucce≈ø≈øe of the mo≈øt valiant and renowned Gentleman, Colonell <hi>Mac-Adams,</hi> who having a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion from the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> to pro≈øecute the De≈øigne againe the Iri≈øh Rebels in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and to further &amp; advance the Cau≈øe of the Prote≈øtants, joyntly re≈øol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with his whole Regiment (con≈øi≈øting of ≈øeven hundred Foot) to try ≈øtrange ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures abroad, and to change their Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Garri≈øons.</p>
            <p>And thereupon took ≈øhipping at <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øayle,</hi> and ≈øet to Sea, being conducted by divers of the Parliament ≈øhips; and after few dayes ≈øayle, they landed at a place cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Dingle,</hi> a ≈øtrong place in poffe≈ø≈øion of
<pb facs="tcp:160186:3"/> the Rebels, and very well fortified, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly fell upon the Workes, ≈øcaled them, and forced their pa≈ø≈øage into the town, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting many of the Rebels to the ≈øword, and cau≈øed the re≈øt to flye, leaving all their arms and ammunition behind them, and great ≈øtore of money, and other rich booty, and after a hot skirmi≈øh, and bloody conflict, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Ma≈øters of the Ca≈øtle, taking divers pri≈øoners; but this renowned Colonel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too ventrous, received a dangerous ≈øhot from the Ca≈øtle.</p>
            <p>Then the ≈øaid Colonel <hi>Mac-Adams</hi> with his ≈øtout Regiment, marched ≈øome 5 miles up into the Country, pur≈øuing the Enemy beating them to the Hills and Mountaines, in≈øomuch, that at the la≈øt, great Bodies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to draw down, which cau≈øed the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell and his Regiment to retreat down to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Sea-Coa≈øt, and in their way fired the Garri≈øon of <hi>Dingle,</hi> and the Ca≈øtle; this being done, they betook them≈øelves to their ≈øhipping, and ≈øo ≈øayled up the ≈øtately River of <hi>Limbricke,</hi> and being within two or three leagues of <hi>Bonrattie,</hi> the Souldiers began to prepare them≈øelves for ≈øhore, and at the la≈øt
<pb facs="tcp:160186:4"/> rived there in ≈øafety. The afore≈øaid Collonel having landed his Regiment, drew them up in Battalia, and there made a gallant ≈øpeech unto them, concerning their pre≈øent De≈øign again≈øt the Earl of <hi>Thomand,</hi> and hie party, boing in number about fifteen hundred: the Colonel had no ≈øooner ended his Oration, but the Souldiers ≈øet up ≈øuch a <hi>Halli-looe,</hi> that cau≈øed all the Iri≈øh thereabouts, to leave their own hou≈øes, and betake them≈øelves to their Boggs and Woods.</p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Thomend</hi> were ≈øore amazed to ≈øee ≈øuch a gallant Fleet at Sea, and ≈øo brave a Body on Land, that immediatly hee retired to <hi>Sixe-mile Budge,</hi> where he drew up in a Body, with a re≈øolution to give our Forces battle.</p>
