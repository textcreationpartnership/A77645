            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HAving received a Letter from you, da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the 15. of <hi>March,</hi> 1646. intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting your earneſt deſire to me, for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting of ſuch paſſages and Occurrents, which ſhall (at any time) happen within
<pb facs="tcp:160186:3"/> this diſtreſſed &amp; moſt diſconſolited King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
            <p>Therefore, to ſatisfie your expectation, &amp; to acquaint you with the ſtate and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Nation, I ſhall deſire you to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ufe theſe enſuing lines, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Rebels are very ſtrong, having great bodies abroad, making ſeueral inroades up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Proteſtants quarters; yet not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſo often, as formerly, by reaſon of the gallant motion, and happy ſucceſſe of the moſt valiant and renowned Gentleman, Colonell <hi>Mac-Adams,</hi> who having a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> to proſecute the Deſigne againe the Iriſh Rebels in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and to further &amp; advance the Cauſe of the Proteſtants, joyntly reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with his whole Regiment (conſiſting of ſeven hundred Foot) to try ſtrange ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures abroad, and to change their Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Garriſons.</p>
            <p>And thereupon took ſhipping at <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayle,</hi> and ſet to Sea, being conducted by divers of the Parliament ſhips; and after few dayes ſayle, they landed at a place cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Dingle,</hi> a ſtrong place in poffeſſion of
<pb facs="tcp:160186:3"/> the Rebels, and very well fortified, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly fell upon the Workes, ſcaled them, and forced their paſſage into the town, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting many of the Rebels to the ſword, and cauſed the reſt to flye, leaving all their arms and ammunition behind them, and great ſtore of money, and other rich booty, and after a hot skirmiſh, and bloody conflict, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Maſters of the Caſtle, taking divers priſoners; but this renowned Colonel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too ventrous, received a dangerous ſhot from the Caſtle.</p>
            <p>Then the ſaid Colonel <hi>Mac-Adams</hi> with his ſtout Regiment, marched ſome 5 miles up into the Country, purſuing the Enemy beating them to the Hills and Mountaines, inſomuch, that at the laſt, great Bodies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to draw down, which cauſed the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell and his Regiment to retreat down to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Sea-Coaſt, and in their way fired the Garriſon of <hi>Dingle,</hi> and the Caſtle; this being done, they betook themſelves to their ſhipping, and ſo ſayled up the ſtately River of <hi>Limbricke,</hi> and being within two or three leagues of <hi>Bonrattie,</hi> the Souldiers began to prepare themſelves for ſhore, and at the laſt
<pb facs="tcp:160186:4"/> rived there in ſafety. The aforeſaid Collonel having landed his Regiment, drew them up in Battalia, and there made a gallant ſpeech unto them, concerning their preſent Deſign againſt the Earl of <hi>Thomand,</hi> and hie party, boing in number about fifteen hundred: the Colonel had no ſooner ended his Oration, but the Souldiers ſet up ſuch a <hi>Halli-looe,</hi> that cauſed all the Iriſh thereabouts, to leave their own houſes, and betake themſelves to their Boggs and Woods.</p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Thomend</hi> were ſore amazed to ſee ſuch a gallant Fleet at Sea, and ſo brave a Body on Land, that immediatly hee retired to <hi>Sixe-mile Budge,</hi> where he drew up in a Body, with a reſolution to give our Forces battle.</p>
            <p>But ſeeing them come on with ſuch a magnanimous courage, and our yellow Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours in the Van, they immediatly threw down their Armes, and betooke themſelves to the Mountaines, leaving all their provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Bagg and Baggage behind them.</p>
            <p>Thus it hath pleaſed God to crown this ſmall party of the proteſtants with Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, giving them tryumphant ſucceſſe in all
<pb facs="tcp:160186:4"/> their enterprizes: For (indeed) the Colonel were very perfect in the knowledge of the country, exceeding expert in the Diſcipline; and moſt wiſe and vigilant in all his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
